# Drawing-using-GeneticAlgorithms

It also supports user-created sampling masks, in case you'd like to specify regions where more brushstrokes are needed (for ex, to allocate more finer details)

## Python
You would need the following python 3 libraries:

* OpenCV 
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib 
* Jupyter Notebook

To start, open the Drawing-using-GeneticAlgorithms.ipynb and run the example code
